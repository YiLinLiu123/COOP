#### Comments for Paul's Resume

##### First Impressions

-   Not very good use of space. Either commit to using only one page or go for two pages. I think you should go for 1 page. You definitely have enough whitespace to condense everything. 

-   Split up Technical Projects and Experiences. Content-wise, your resume is very similar to Svena's. You both have one job, one design team, and robots. You want people to differentiate between what you have been paid for and what your activities are. It mostly reflects nicely on you, the fact that you are passionate on projects outside of class. 

-   Tiny formatting issues. I don't really like it if a bullet point item extends beyond one line.  If you do, it's neater if you keep it near full lines. But don't have stuff acting like add-ons on the 2nd lines. 

-   This resume should be as technical as possible. Thus, you should add more technical content in your technical sections and less of the soft skills. Just looking at things right now, you spend more lines talking about baking than the robot course. 

-   Oh and I accidentally deleted the co-op header.

##### Specific Things

I've annotated your resume with orange numbers, they correspond to the following list.  Note that I can't really comment on the technical stuff much, I'll just be giving general feedback.

1.  Make your name bigger, more obvious
2.  Shouldn't you have an education section with your degree and academic standing? This is assuming that you're applying to places like Tesla, they need to know where you from. 
3.  I added this title for you, but please fill in your co-op title. 
4.  Kind of confusing, how do you use git (version control) to document key findings?
5.  Be more specific on what you did. Svena went into detail on the linear rails, drive trains, and claw mechanism. I did the same for the circuitry and control system. Maybe separate your work up into two lines, one for mech and the other for electrical.
